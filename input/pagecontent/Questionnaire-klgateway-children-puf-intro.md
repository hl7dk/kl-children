### Scope and usage
KLGatewayChildrenPUF is used to define the Copenhagen Infant Mental Health Screening/Psykisk Udvikling OG Funktion (PUF). The link-ids from this questionnaire have to be referred in the QuestionnaireResponse, that holds the answers to an PUF questionnaire.

Note that this Questionnaire defines datatype (boolean and integer) This is done for each item in the Questionnaire. However, the FHIR-validator is not able to validate a QuestionnaireResponse using these rules (Because there is a very loose coupling between Questionaire and QuestionaireResponse in FHIR). We encourage vendors to ensure that responses are validated according to the rules described here.
