# Implementation guide source files for KL-children
 
This repository contains Local Goverment Denmark FHIR profiles and documentation for the reporting of data from the Danish health promotion and disease prevention program. Local Goverment Denmark is a non-profit organisation financed by the Danish municipalities. The Danish municipalities deliver health and social care in homes, nursing homes and local facilities. The terminology related to this project can be found in FK-klassifikation, and in FHIR format at https://fhir.kl.dk/term/

Changes to the IG are automatically built and viewed at http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/kl-children/ as an HL7 Implementation Guide, version 1.0.0 has not yet been released, but when the time comes, it will have its permanent adress at https://fhir.kl.dk/kl-children
